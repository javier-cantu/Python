#level1: Introduction and Core Functionality Test

This section tests basic paragraph structure and line joining.

A simple paragraph with one line break. It should be joined into a single logical paragraph
by the script 02. The result should only have one '===' at the end.

#level2: Custom Class and Inline Formatting Test

This paragraph tests the new custom class syntax and how it interacts with tokenization.

The <important>critical data</important> must be highlighted. This <small_caps>acronym</small_caps> is new. We need to check if the class <error>fails</error> to parse properly. Another sentence follows.

#level2: Abbreviation and Title Protection Test

This paragraph includes various abbreviations and titles defined in the script 02, which must NOT split the sentence.

The meeting started at 9:00 A.M. and ended at 5:00 P.M. Mr. Smith, Dr. House, and Prof. Miller were present, as well as Sr. Jones and Jr. Peterson. We discussed a lot of topics, e.g., the new U.S. policy, etc. This is true c. 2024.

#level2: Acronym and Initial Chain Test

This tests complex acronyms and name initial chains, including the problematic A.B.C. case.

#level2: Ellipsis and Formatting Test

This tests inconsistent ellipsis formats and inline HTML.

"Very well," said the wizard. "If you will not banish the nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a better school. . . ." She then left. A few more tests.... Here are four dots. The text supports <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i>.

#level2: Image and Separator Test
